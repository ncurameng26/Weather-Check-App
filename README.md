# API-Project

What I used:
-Axios
-AirVisual API
-React
-Vite

What I learned:
-How to properly format a React app with components
-How to access web API's
-Properly Passing functions through different components
-Using .env files

What I had trouble with:
-Could not integreate Twilio due to the require() method not working in due to the use of VITE and its client sided rendering
-Had some trouble accessing API at first, eventually resolved
-Too many request Errors slowing down my testing, issues with useEffect hook.
